After running your web-socket server,

localhost:[port]/client.html -> you will get the message "upgrade required".

file:///[folder]/client.html -> you can see your HTML file.

because you don't have any web-server with a web-socket or you did not configure your web server for your web-socket. So, you should use your file system.
